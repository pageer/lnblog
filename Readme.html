<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>LnBlog is a simple weblog package written in PHP which stores data in text files.
It is strives to be easy to use, easy to manage, and feature rich while
maintaining a clean, elegant, and modular design. It is built to create
sites with a clean, directory-based URL structure and valid XHTML and CSS for
style and layout.&nbsp; Plus, it's light on requirements and cross-platform.<br />
</p>


<h2>Status</h2>


<p>Currently, LnBlog is in the active development, which just means
that it is functional and tested, but not anywhere close to done yet. There
are still lots of features to add, both in the back-end code and in terms of
interface elements. You can see the <a href="TODO">to do list</a> to get an
idea of what is currently planned. If you have any comments or suggestions,
or if you have any problems or find any bugs, feel free to <a href="mailto:pageer@skepticats.com">e-mail me</a>.</p>


<h2>Requirements</h2>


<p>LnBlog is fairly light on
requirements. It does not require any particular operating system or
web server and is known to work on
Linux/Apache and WinXP/IIS. The only hard and fast requirements are the
following:</p>


<ol>


<li>PHP 4.0 or greater.</li>
<li>Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE), which is enabled
by default in most PHP packages.</li>
<li>The ability for scripts to read and write files to the server. To do this,
you must <em>either</em> have FTP access to the web server and configure LnBLog
to use it, <em>or</em> have PHP's safe mode disabled and appropriate directory permissions
set on the web server.<br />
</li>
</ol>


<h2>Feature List</h2>


<ul>


<li><strong>Works in Safe Mode</strong> when using FTP support.</li>
<li>Anonymous reader comments.</li>
<li>Automatically generated RSS feeds for blog entries and comments.</li><li>Send and receive TrackBack pings.</li>
<li>Create multiple user accounts with basic serucity on entires and blogs.</li>
<li>E-mail notification when new comments are posted.</li>
<li>Easily create multiple weblogs.</li><li>Create static "articles" in addition to weblog entries.</li>
<li>Change between multiple themes, each of which can have completely a
different look and behavior, i.e. different styles, HTML markup, images, and even client-side scripts.</li>
<li>Default themes use valid XHTML Strict for markup and CSS-based page layout.</li>
<li>Flexible theming system that allows HTML templates, scripts, and stylesheets to be tweaked
on a per-blog basis.</li>
<li>Support for posting with simple auto-markup, a simple subset of BBcode,
or raw HTML code.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Initial Setup</h2>


<p>For step-by-step instructions, please see the
<a href="install.html">install guide</a>. If you're more technically inclined, then it's probably safe to just skip to the summary below.</p>


<p>Here's the quick version. Just
extract the installation archive and
upload the whole LnBlog directory to a location in
the publicly accessible portion of your web hosting account. You can
them navigate
to that directory with your favorite browser to run the configuration
scripts. The first script configures file writing. If you have FTP
access to the web server, you
can use FTP for file writing (this is recommended) by selecting the FTP
option and giving the
appropriate information below. Otherwise, LnBlog will use PHP's
standard filesystem
functions, which will require that Safe Mode be turned off and
appropriate permissions set on the relevant directories.</p>


<p>After file writing support is
configured, you must set an administrator login. This will be used to
add new weblogs as well as to log into the ones you create. After
that's
set, you can log in and start adding new blogs and/or users. There are also
administrative functions to
modify a blog and update a blog (used when upgrading LnBlog).</p>


<h2>Upgrading</h2>


<p>Upgrading your LnBlog installation is actually quite easy.&nbsp;
If you are paranoid, you will want to make backup copies of the
configuration files in your LnBlog directory.&nbsp; These files are
named fsconfig.php, passwd.php, and sitemap.htm, and are used to store
information global to your installation.&nbsp; They are generally
not affected by upgrades, and they are not hard to recreate if
destroyed, but I thought I should warn you anyway.</p>


<p><strong>Exception 1:</strong> The format of passwd.php has changed between versions 0.2 and 0.3 and you should <strong>delete</strong> the old one and
let the software create a new one. Version 0.3 adds support for multiple users using a mechanism that is
incompatible with the previous passwd.php format. After you delete this file, go to your LnBlog administration
page and you will be prompted to create a new administrator account.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception 2:</span> An additional configuration constant, DOCUMENT_ROOT, has been added to fsconfig.php in verion 0.3.2.&nbsp; You
may upgrade by deleting your fsconfig.php and going to the
administrative page to recreate it.&nbsp; However, if your site was
functioning correctly with the old version, it should continue to do so
with the old fsconfig.php file.</p>


<p>To upgrade LnBlog, simply extract the
new version from the ZIP archive and upload it to your web host into
the same location as the old version, overwriting the old
files.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can move or delete the old
installation folder and put the new one in its place, provided you copy
the above mentioned configuration files into the new installation
directory.</p>


<p>Once that's done, you may need
to upgrade the files for each individual blog.&nbsp; This is done
by going to the administration page and using the "upgrade blog"
option.&nbsp; Simply put the relative path to your blog (e.g. myblog, as described in the <a href="#addblog">"Adding New Blogs" section</a>)
and click the "Upgrade" button.&nbsp; This will upgrade the
configuration files for the blog and add any new pages.&nbsp; You
will have to do this separately for each blog that youhave. </p>


<h2>Adding New Users</h2>


<p>In addition to the administrator account, you can create as many new user accounts as you
like. (<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: LnBlog was not buit to handle large numbers of users. While there is no
<em>inherent</em>
limit on the number of users, I doubt that the current implementation
will scale
well. You have been warned.)&nbsp; To create a new account log in
to the LnBlog administration page and click the "Add new user"
link.&nbsp; Only the administrator account can create new users.</p>


<p>The form to add new users
should be fairly self-explanatory.&nbsp; You are required to enter
a username, password, and password confirmation.&nbsp; The real
name, e-mail, and homepage are all optional.&nbsp; However, please
note that the user will (obviously) not receive e-mail confirmation of
comments on his posts if you do not give an e-mail address.</p>


<h2>Security</h2>


<p>LnBlog uses a very simple
security based on user ownership.&nbsp; The rules for determining
what each user can do are as follows</p>


<ol>


<li>The administrator can do everything that can be done.</li>
<li>The owner of a blog can
modify the blog properties (theme, name, number of posts shown, etc.),
can add entries and articles to it,and can modify the entries and articles of other users who post to the blog. </li>
<li>The owner of an entry or article can modify that entry or article, including comments and trackbacks.</li><li>A user can only add articles or entries to a blog he owns or one he is explicitly on the write-list for.</li>
<li>Anybody, user or anonymous reader, can add comments.</li>
</ol>


<p>To put it more succinctly,
there's the administrator (can do anything), the blog owner (can do
anything with the blog), the other users (can do anything with their
own posts - provided they <em>can</em> post), and everybody else (can only post comments).&nbsp;
Which role a particular person will take depends on who they are and
what blog you're talking about.&nbsp;The owner of one blog may be just a regular reader on another.&nbsp; <br />
</p>


<h2><a name="addblog">Adding New Blogs</a></h2>


<p><a name="addblog">Adding new blogs is done on the LnBlog administration page. Only the administrator account
can add new blogs.</a></p>


<p><a name="addblog">To add a new blog, just click
the "Add new blog" link and fill out the form on the resulting
page.&nbsp; The fields define various properties of the blog, and
are as follows:</a></p>


<ol>


<li><a name="addblog"><strong>Blog path</strong>:
The path to the blog on the web server machine.&nbsp; You may
specify either an absolute path or a relative path, in which case the
path is computed relative to your web root directory.&nbsp; So, if
you specify the path "myblog", then the web address of the blog will be
<code>http://www.mysite.com/myblog/</code>
</a></li>
<li><a name="addblog"><strong>Blog owner</strong>: The username of whoever owns the blog.
This is the user who will be allowed to change these settings later. By
default, this is the administrator.</a></li>
<li><a name="addblog"><strong>Additional allowed writers</strong>:
A comma-separated list of usernames other than the owner who can post new
entries and articles to this blog.</a></li>
<li><a name="addblog"><strong>Blog name</strong>: The name of the blog.</a></li>
<li><a name="addblog"><strong>Description</strong>: A short description of the blog.</a></li>
<li><a name="addblog"><strong>Theme</strong>: The theme visual used for the blog.</a></li>
<li><a name="addblog"><strong>Blog name</strong>: The name of the blog.</a></li>
<li><a name="addblog"><strong>Maximum number of entries</strong>:
The maximum number of entries to display on the homepage of the blog.
For example, if this is 10, then the main page of the blog will display the
last 10 entries.</a></li>
<li><a name="addblog"><strong>Maximum number of entries in RSS feeds</strong>:
The maximum number of entries that will be put in the main blog RSS feed.</a></li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="addblog">Adding Entries</a></h2>


<p><a name="addblog">Adding a blog entry is pretty self-explanatory. Just log in and
click on the
"add entry" link. You will be taken to the entry edit screen, where you
can
enter the subject for your entry, the entry text itself, and turn
comments for
this entry on or off.&nbsp; Note that in order to add an entry, you
must either be the owner of the blog you're adding it to, or you must
be on the allowed writers list for that blog.<br />
</a></p>


<p><a name="addblog">There are three possible input modes, which you can change between with the
option buttons below the edit area. They are:</a></p>


<ol>


<li><a name="addblog"><strong>Auto-markup</strong>: Adds HTML paragraphs and line breaks based on the plain-text input and converts all http:// and ftp:// URLs to links.</a></li>
<li><a name="addblog"><strong>LBCode</strong>: Use a dialect of the BBCode markup popular in
web forums to markup your page. Paragraphs and line breaks are inserted like
with auto-markup, but you can also include other supported tags. See the
</a><a href="#lbcode">LBCode Syntax</a> section for details.
</li>
<li><strong>Raw HTML</strong>: The text you type is treated as raw HTML code.
No processing is done and there's no guarantee that your page will validate.
In other words, this is for people who know what they're doing.</li>
</ol>


<h2>User Comments</h2>


<p>LnBlog allows anonymous user comments by default.&nbsp; You can turn
off the ability to add comments with a checkbox on the entry edit
screen.&nbsp; Comments have a required body text and optional subject,
name, e-mail, and homepage fields.&nbsp; For logged-in users, comments
will also store the username, so that the up-to-date name, e-mail, and
homepage can be displayed automatically.&nbsp; Currently, comments
cannot be edited, but they can be deleted by users with permission to
modify the entry.</p>


<p>If the owner of a post has an e-mail address specified for his
username, then he will receive e-mail notification of any new comments
on his posts.&nbsp; The e-mail is send using PHP's mail() function,
so that must be correctly configured for your server.&nbsp; The
messages themselves are in plain-text format and include the URL of the
comment, as well as the comment itself and any personal information
entered by the reader.<br />
</p>


<h2>TrackBacks</h2>


<p>LnBlog has some very primitive support for Trackbacks.&nbsp; Each
entry has a trackback URL and will store and display any trackback
pings it receives. <br />
</p>


<p>To send a trackback ping, you must be logged in and have permission to modify the blog.&nbsp;
You can then click on the "Send trackback ping" link for your blog
entry and start the two-step ping process.&nbsp; The first step is to
enter the URL you wish to ping.&nbsp; The second is to confirm the ping
data and send it. <br />
</p>


<p>Due mostly to laziness on my part, LnBlog does not yet support
"real" trackback pings.&nbsp; Instead, it uses a simple HTML form with
element names conforming to the TrackBack specification to submit the
HTTP POST request.&nbsp; As a result of this, you will notice that
after the ping, you are directed to the page you pinged, which will
probably show you the XML response dictated by the specification.&nbsp;
If this is a 0 (zero), that means the ping succeeded.&nbsp; Otherwise,
you should hopefully see an error message.&nbsp; Because of the
suckiness of this situation, sending a trackback ping will open a new
browser window so that you don't have to manually go back to your blog.</p>


<p>LnBlog currently does not support TrackBack URL
autodiscovery.&nbsp; There is no bookmarklet to pick up trackback URLs
for other blogs and there is no RDF section embedded in LnBlog entries.</p>


<h2><a name="lbcode">LBCode Syntax</a></h2>


<p>LnBlog supports marking up your
text with LBCode, which is a
variant of BBCode, the markup language used in many popular web-board
and forum packages, such as phpBB. I call this dialect LBCode because
it makes
absolutely no attempt to match the official syntax (if there is such a
thing)
of BBCode. The primary purpose of LBCode is to let the user write rich
text
that is valid XHTML 1.0 Strict without having to learn any XHTML or
worry about making mistakes while writing. Below is
a table of the currently supported tags, with descriptions, example,
and the mapping to HTML. Please note that LnBlog does not currently
handle LBCode
errors gracefully - incorrect syntax will simply be displayed as plain
text.</p>

<h4>Notes on LBCode</h4>


<ol>


<li>The line breaks between items in numbered lists and unordered lists are <em>not</em>
optional. You <em>must</em> put each item on a single line and you must put the beginning
and ending tags on their own line.</li>
<li>When you give just a file name (i.e. a path containing <em>no</em>
'/' characters)
as the target for an [img] or [url] tag, LnBlog will automatically
convert it
to an absolute URI to a file in the entry directory when it is
displayed. This feature is provided for two reasons: because you will
not know the absoute URI of a
blog entry until <em>after</em> you post it and because the post can be displayed at its
permanent location, in which case the relative link is valid, or in another place (the
front page of the blog or an RSS feed), where the relative link is <em>not</em> valid.</li>
<li>In Mozilla-based browser, [ac]
and [ab] both do the same thing. They
are both provided because there is a semantic difference, i.e. that an
abbreviation is simply a shortening of a phrase using the initial
letters,
whereas an acronym is such a shortening that actually spells a
pronounceable word. However, while the &lt;abbr&gt; tag is
often the
semantically correct one, Internet Explorer 6 doesn't support it, so
you
should use this tag with care.</li>
<li>In the [img] tag, the text between the opening and closing tags <em>is
required</em>.
This is because it is used as the text for both the ALT
attribute, which is required in XHTML, and the TITLE attribute, which
gives you the tooltips in Mozilla-based browsers. Since Internet
Explorer incorrectly uses the ALT text for tooltips, you'll actually
get the same tooltip in all browsers.</li>
<li>In Mozilla-based browsers, the
&lt;q&gt; tag renders quotation marks automatically. However,
this depends on the CSS2 :before and :after
pseudo-elements, which are not supported by Internet Explorer, so use
this with care. Note that in the default LnBlog stylsheets, the
&lt;q&gt;
tag is rendered with italic text, so that even in Internet Explorer, it
can be distinguished from normal text.</li><li>The
current LBCode handler does not deal gracefully with multiline
tags.&nbsp; So if, e.g., you have a multiline block quotation or code block, the
LBCode handler will still put &lt;br /&gt; tags in for the line
breaks. <br />
</li><li>In addition to the [img] tag, there are also [img-left] and
[img-right] tags.&nbsp; These are exactly the same, except that the
resulting HTML includes a CSS style to float the image to the left or
right respectively.&nbsp; This is used to flow text around an image.</li>

</ol>


<h2>LBCode Editor</h2>


<p>When posting using LBCode
markup, you can use LnBlog's simple Javascript-based
LBCode editor to insert the codes for you. The editor is simply a
series of buttons
and two text boxes, labeled "text" and "attribute." The "text" box is
used to enter
the contents of an LBCode tag, i.e. the actual text the goes between
the opening and closing tags. The "attribute" box is used to enter any
attribute for the opening tag.
such as the URL for an image or link, or the phrase that an
appbreviation or acronym
stands for.</p>


<p>To use the editor, just type in
the text and attribute you want and click the appropriate button. If
you want to add a word in bold, type your word into the box
labeled "text" and click the bold button. If you want to add a link,
put the link
text in the "text" box and the URL for the link in the "attribute" box
and click the
URL button. The corresponding markup will be added to your post at the
current cursor
position or at the end, depending on your browser's Javascript support.
Inserting at the
cursor position works on Opera 8.0, Firefox 1.0.3, and sorta-kinda
works in Internet Explorer 6.0. I haven't tried it on other browsers,
so your mileage may vary.</p>


<p>An extra feature of the editor
is that the abbreviation and acronym buttons will save any attributes
you use during your post and add them automatically. So, for example,
if you enter the abbreviation with the text "GNU" and the attribute
"GNU's Not UNIX," then if you mention GNU later in your post, you can
just enter "GNU" for the text and
leave the attribute blank. When you hit the abbreviation button, the
attribute "GNU's Not UNIX" will be added automatically.
</p>


<h2><abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> Features</h2>


<p>While LnBlog is a technically a weblog package, it also includes several
"mini-<abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>"
features. These
exist mostly for the sake of maintaining the design consistency of the
site and making it slightly easier to manage. The following sections
describe these.</p>


<h3>Adding Articles</h3>


<p>An article in LnBlog is just a
blog entry with a different URL and different display template. It's
basically a cheap and easy way to add
static content that meshes with the overall look
and feel of the blog, but doesn't require any extra
work. You still get BBCode support and revision history, but the URL
structure is pneumonic and comments are turned off by default. You can
enter the last component of the
article URL when you first post it or go with the default, which is to
use the subject with all letters converted to lower case, spaces
converted to underscores,
and all other characters removed.&nbsp; In addition, articles have
a "sticky" attribute that you can set.&nbsp; This will cause a link
to the article to be displayed in the sidebar (provided you're using
one of the default themes).<br />
</p>


<h3>Uploading Files</h3>


<p>LnBlog provides pages to upload
files to the root of the current blog or to the
current entry or article. Currently, you can only upload one file at a
time. You should also note the file size limit when trying to upload a
file. To change this,
must change the values of the PHP configuration variables
upload_max_size and post_max_size by creating a .htaccess file (if you
use Apache) or by modifying
the system php.ini file.</p>


<h3>Sitemap Editing</h3>


<p>Part of LnBlog's basic page
layout includes a sitemap, also refered to as the menubar.&nbsp; In
the default theme, this is the bar just under the banner with your blog
name.&nbsp; It is intended for global site navigation, e.g. to go
from one blog to another or to other sections of your
website.&nbsp; Needless to say, you will want to customize it for
your own site.<br />
</p>


<p>There are two ways to edit the
menubar: globally for al LnBlog blogs, or locally to just the current
blog.&nbsp; To edit the global sitemap, use the link on the LnBlog
administration page where you will see a link to the sitemap
editor.&nbsp; To change the sitemap for a particular blog, log in
and use the link in the administration section of the blog
sidebar.&nbsp; Note that setting a sitemap for the blog will override
the global sitemap.</p>


<p>The sitemap editor is a simple
Javascript form that creates a list of links.&nbsp; Just enter the
text you want for the link, the tooltip (what to display when hovering
the mouse over the link), and the target <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
for the link, either relative or absolute.&nbsp; When you click the
"Add Link" button, a line will be added to the output box with the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
code for the information you specified.&nbsp; When a page is displayed,
LnBlog will read this file and put each line into a list item to be
displayed in the menubar.&nbsp; Please note that, currently, if you
want to create a more complicated menu layout, you will have to modify
the menubar template. </p>
