<h1>LnBlog</h1>
<p>A simple file-based weblog focused on design elegance.</p>
<p>Copyright (c) 2005, Peter A. Geer &lt;<a href="mailto:pageer@skepticats.com">pageer@skepticats.com</a>&gt;</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>LnBlog is a simple blog written in PHP which stores data in text files.
It is strives to be easy to use, easy to manage, and feature rich whil 
maintaining a clean, elegant, and modular design.  It is built to create 
sites with a clean, directory-based URL structure and valid XHTML and CSS for
style and layout.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Currently, LnBlog is in the active developmen, which just means 
that it is functional and tested, but not anywhere close to done yet.  There
are still lots of features to add, both in the back-end code and in terms of
interface elements.  You can see the <a href="TODO">to do list</a> to get an
idea of what is currently planned.  If you have any comments or suggestions, 
or if you have any problems or find any bugs, feel free to <a href="mailto:pageer@skepticats.com">e-mail me</a>.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>LnBlog is fairly light on requirements.  It does not require any 
particular operating system or web server and is known to work on 
Linux/Apache and WinXP/IIS.  The only hard requirements are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>PHP 4.0 or greater.</li>
<li>Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE), which is enabled
by default in most PHP packages.</li>
<li>The ability for scripts to read and write files to the server.  This 
implies that <strong>Safe Mode is turned off</strong> and that file and
directory permissions are set up correctly.  If your web host
has safe mode turned on, try contacting their support department and asking 
them to turn off PHP's Safe Mode for your account.  My hosting company did it
with no questions asked, but your milage may vary.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Feature List</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Anonymous reader comments.</li>
  <li>Automatically generated RSS feeds.</li>
  <li>Easily create multiple weblogs, with independent or shared logins.</li>
  <li>Change between multiple themes, each of which can have completely a
  different look and behavior, i.e. different styles, HTML markup, images, 
  and even client-side scripts.</li>
  <li>Default themes use valid XHTML Strict and CSS-based page layout.</li>
  <li>Flexible HTML templating system that allows templates to be tweaked
  on a per-blog basis.</li>
  <li>Support for posting with simple auto-markup, a simple subset of BBcode,
  or raw HTML code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Initial Setup</h2>

<p>For step-by-step instructions, please see the 
<a href="install.html">install guide</a>.  If you're more technically 
inclined, then it's probably safe to just skip to the summary below.</p>

<p>Here's the quick version.  Just extract the installation archive and
upload the whole LnBlog directory to a location in
the publicly accessible portion of your web hosting account.  Make sure the
directory is writable by the web server so that you can set a password.  (You
can always change the permissions back afterward, if this bothers you.) 
This username and password
will be used for the administration pages and for any blogs you create.  
When you're done with that, fire up your favorite browser and point it 
to the URL of LnBlog on your web host,
e.g. http://www.mysite.com/lnblog/ or something similar. This will run the
LnBlog setup, which will prompt you to create a login and allow you to
create a new blog.</p>

<p>Please note that you may need to change the file permissions on some 
folders to make LnBlog work.  In particular, to
create a new blog, the web server must be able to write files in the 
specified folder, and if that folder does not exist, the web server must be
able to create it.  Usually, this means that you must either change the 
permissions on your web root directory to be writable by the web server,
or you must create and change the permissions on each blog directory by hand.
Alternatively, you could create a singe directory that is writable by the 
web server and put all your blogs under that.  
It's your site, so it's your call.
</p>

<h2>Adding Entries</h2>

<p>Adding a blog entry is pretty self-explanatory.  Just log in and click on the
"add entry" link.  You will be taken to the entry edit screen, where you can 
enter the subject for your entry, the entry text itself, and turn comments for
this entry on or off.</p>

<p>There are three possible input modes, which you can change between with the
option  buttons below the edit area.  They are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Auto-markup</strong>: Add HTML paragraphs and line breaks based 
on the plain-text input and convert all http and ftp URLs to links.</li>
<li><strong>BBCode</strong>: Use a dialect of the BBCode markup popular in
web forums to markup your page.  Paragraphs and line breaks are inserted like
with auto-markup, but you can also include other supported tags.  See the
<a href="#lbcode">LBCode Syntax</a> section for details.
</li>
<li><strong>Raw HTML</strong>: The text you type is treated as raw HTML code.
No processing is done and there's no guarantee that your page will validate.
In other words, this is for people who know what they're doing.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="lbcode">LBCode Syntax</a></h2>
<p>LnBlog supports marking up your text with a variant of LBCode, which is a 
variant of BBCode, the markup language used in many popular web-board and 
forums, including phpBB.  I call this dialect LBCode because it makes 
absolutely no attempt to match the official syntax (if there is such a thing)
of BBCode.  The promary purpose of LBCode is to let the user write rich text
that is valid XHTML 1.0 Strict without having to learn any XHTML.  Below is 
a table of the currently supported tags, with descrition, example, and the 
mapping to HTML.  Please note that LnBlog does not currently handle LBCode
errors gracefully - errors in tags will simply be ignored.</p>

<h4>Notes on LBCode</h4>
<ol>
	<li>When you give just a file name (i.e. a path containing to '/' characters)
	as the target for an [img] or [url] tag, LnBlog will automatically convert it
	to an absolute URI to a file in the entry directory when it is displayed.  This 
	feature is provided for two reasons: because you will not know the absoute URI of a 
	blog entry until <em>after</em> you post it and because the post can be displayed at its
	permanent location (in which case the relative link is valid) or in another place (the
	front page of the blog or an RSS feed), where the relative link is <em>not</em> valid.</li>
	<li>In Mozilla-based browser, [ac] and [ab] both do the same thing.  They
	are both provided because there is a semantic difference, i.e. that an 
	abbreviation is simply a shortening of a phrase using the initial letters,
	whereas an acronym is such a shortening that actually spells a 
	pronounceable word.  However, while the &lt;abbr&gt; tag is often the
	semantically correct one, Internet Explorer 6 doesn't support it, so you
	should use this tag with care.</li>
	<li>In the [img] tag, the text between the opening and closing tags <em>is
	required</em>.  This is because it is used as the text for both the ALT 
	attribute, which is required in XHTML, and the TITLE attribute, which 
	gives you the tooltips in Mozilla-based browsers.  Since Internet 
	Explorer incorrectly uses the ALT text for tooltips, you'll actually get 
	the same tooltip in all browsers.</li>
	<li>In Mozilla-based browsers, the &lt;q&gt; tag renders quotation marks 
	automatically.  However, this depends on the CSS2 :before and :after 
	pseudo-elements, which are not supported by Internet Explorer, so use
	this with care.  Note that in the default LnBlog stylsheets, the &lt;q&gt;
	tag is rendered with italic text, so that even in Internet Explorer, it
	can be distinguished from normal text.</li>
</ol>

<h2><abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> Features</h2>

<p>While LnBlog is a technically a weblog package, it also includes several
"mini-<abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> features.  These 
exist mostly for the sake of maintaining the design conssitency of the site 
and making it slightly easier to manage.  The following sections describe these.</p>

<h3>Adding Articles</h3>
<p>An article in LnBlog is just a blog entry with a different URL and 
different display template.  It's basically a cheap and easy way to add 
static content that meshes with the overall look
and feel of the blog, but doesn't require any extra work.  You still get 
BBCode support and revision history, but the URL structure is pneumonic 
and comments are turned off by default.  You can enter the last component of the
article URL when you first post it or go with the default, which is to use the 
subject with all letters converted to lower case, spaces converted to underscores,
and all other characters removed.</p>

<h3>Uploading Files</h3>
<p>LnBlog provides pages to upload files to the root of the current blog or to the
current entry or article.  Currently, you can only upload one file at a time.  You 
should also note the file size limit when trying to upload a file.  To change this,
must change the values of the PHP configuration variables upload_max_size and 
post_max_size by creating a .htaccess file (if you use Apache) or by modifying 
the system php.ini file.</p>
