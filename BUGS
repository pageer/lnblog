This file lists bugs known to exist at release time.  If you find a bug in this 
release that is NOT mentioned in the list, then please report it.

Version 0.8.0:
- Calendar highlights current day even if it's showing a different month.
- Calendar preserves parts of the query string that it shouldn't, e.g. when
clicking on a particular day and then clicking the previous month, the day gets
preserved, even though it shouldn't.
- The Blog uri() method is incomplete/broken.  The "listyear" case doesn't work 
and it's missing "listmonth" and "showmonth" cases.
- Inclusion of auto-generated enclosure data is dependent on the RSS2 plugin 
running AFTER the file is uploaded.  If the file has not yet been uploaded, the
enclosure will be silently omitted, which should not happen.
- When trying to use editfile.php to modify a file you don't have permission to
modify (which you shouldn't be doing anyway), the redirect takes you to 
LnBlog/pages/index.php, which doesn't exist.
