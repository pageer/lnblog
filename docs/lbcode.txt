Document: LBCode Markup

Section: Markup Types
LnBlog allows you to write your blog entries and articles in any of three formats.  The simplest is 
auto-markup, which automatically inserts HTML code for line breaks, paragraph breaks, and converts
text URLs into hyperlinks.  The most complex is, of course, raw HTML code.  In this format, LnBlog 
will not do anything to your text at all and will simply output it as HTML code.  The default format
is called LBCode and is a dialect of the BBCode-style markup used by many popular web forum systems.
The name LBCode is used to distinguish it from the markup used by other systems, because LnBlog 
makes absolutely no attempt to be compatible with other software in this regard.

Section: Tag Chart
Most LBCode constructs map directly so some HTML code.  The following table summarizes the available
LBCode statements.  As with the auto-markup mode, line breaks are converted to HTML BR tags and 
double line breaks are converted to new paragraphs.
(start code)
[b]bold[/b]                       =>  <strong>bold</strong>

[i]italic[/i]                     =>  <em>italic</em>

[u]underline[/u]                  =>  <span style="text-decoration: underline">underline</span>

[ab=Full phrase]abbreviation[/ab] =>  <abbr title="Full phrase">abbreviation</abbr>

[ac=Full phrase]acronym[/ac]      =>  <acronym title="Full phrase">acronym</acronym>

[code]Source code[/code]          =>  <code>Source code</code>

[t]Teletype text[/t]              =>  <tt>Teletype text</tt>

[color=red]Red text[/color]       =>  <span style="color: red">Red text</span>

[h]Header[/h]                     =>  <h3>Header</h3>

[q]Quote[/q]                      =>  [q]Quote[/q]

[quote]Block quotation[/quote]    =>  <blockquote>Block quotation</blockquote>

[quote=http://www.somesite.com/]Block quotation[/quote]    =>
                   <blockquote cite="http://www.somesite.com/">Block quotation</blockquote>

[url=http://www.google.com]Google[/url]    =>
                   <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>

[img=http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif]Google logo[/img]   =>
                   <img src="http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif" alt="Google logo" title="Google logo" />

[img-right=http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif]Google logo[/img-right]   =>
                   <img alt="Google logo" title="Google logo" style="float: right; clear: none;" src="http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif" />

[img-left=http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif]Google logo[/img-left]  =>
                   <img alt="Google logo" title="Google logo" style="float: left; clear: none;" src="http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif" />

[numlist]                       <ol>
[*]First item         =>        <li>First item</li>
[*]Second item                  <li>Second item</li>
[/numlist]                      </ol> 
 
[list]                          <ul>
[*]First item         =>        <li>First item</li>
[*]Second item                  <li>Second item</li>
[/list]                         </ul> 
(end code)

Section: A Note on URLs

LBCode includes a feature to automatically absolutize URLs.  Basically, if you do not enter a relative URL, such as 
"myimage.jpg", it will automatically be converted to an absolute URL, such as "http://somehost/somepath/myimage.jpg".  
The conversion is done automatically at run-time and will show up in the HTML code sent to the browser.
This is provided for because an absolute URL is required in order to properly display a blog entry on the front page or in
RSS feeds, and because you will not know the final URL until _after_ you post the entry.  Plus it's a conventient shortcut.

The rules are as follows.
- URLs that do not contain any slashes (/), colons (:), or at signs (@), such as "myimage.jpg", will be treated as relative 
  to the current blog entry.  So the URL "myimage.jpg" will be converted to something like
  http://www.myhost.com/myblog/entries/2006/03/02/1234_56/myimage.jpg.
- URLs that contain slashes but no at signs or colons, *and* do not start with a slash, will be treated as relative to the 
  current blog root.  So, for example, "content/article/myfile.zip" will be converted to something like 
  http://www.myhost.com/myblog/content/article/myfile.zip.
- Lastly, URLs that start with a slash, but do not contain colons or at signs, will be interpreted as relative to the 
  root of the web site.  So "/otherblog/somefile.txt" will be converted to something like 
  http://www.myhost.com/otherblog/somefile.txt.

Section: Other Notes

There are several other things to note with regard to the various LBCode statements.
- The line breaks between items in numbered lists and unordered lists are not optional. You must put each item on a single 
  line and you must put the beginning and ending tags on their own line. 
- In Mozilla-based browser, [ac] and [ab] both do the same thing. They are both provided because there is a semantic 
  difference, i.e. that an abbreviation is simply a shortening of a phrase using the initial letters, whereas an acronym is 
  such a shortening that actually spells a pronounceable word. However, while the <abbr> tag is often the semantically 
  correct one, Internet Explorer 6 doesn't support it, so you should use this tag with care. 
- In the [img] tag, the text between the opening and closing tags is required. This is because it is used as the text for 
  both the ALT attribute, which is required in XHTML, and the TITLE attribute, which gives you the tooltips in Mozilla-based 
  browsers. Since Internet Explorer incorrectly uses the ALT text for tooltips, you'll actually get the same tooltip in all 
  browsers. 
- In Mozilla-based browsers, the <q> tag renders quotation marks automatically. 
  However, this depends on the CSS2 :before and :after pseudo-elements, which are not supported by Internet Explorer, 
  so use this with care. Note that in the default 
  LnBlog stylsheets, the <q> tag is rendered with italic text, so that even in Internet Explorer, it can be distinguished 
  from normal text.
- The current LBCode handler does not deal gracefully with multiline tags.  So if, e.g., you have a multiline block quotation 
  or code block, the LBCode handler will still put <br /> tags in for the line breaks.  This may or may not be what you want.
