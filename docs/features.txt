Document: Feature List

Here is a list of the features currently supported by LnBlog.  These features 
are spread out between the core of LnBlog and the standard plugins.  Plugins can
be disabled, so if you don't want a feature that is implemented in a plugin, you
can just turn it off.  Also, all elements of the sidebar (as well as the 
menubar/sitemap and page banner) are implemented as plugins, and so can be 
configured and turned off just like other plugins.
