Document: Feature List

Here is a list of the features currently supported by LnBlog.  These features are spread out between the core of LnBlog and the standard plugins.  Plugins can be disabled, so if you don't want a feature that is implemented in a plugin, you can just turn it off.  Also, all elements of the sidebar (as well as the menubar/sitemap and page banner) are implemented as plugins, and so can be configured and turned off just like other plugins.
