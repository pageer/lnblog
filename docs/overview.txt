Document: Overview and Setup

Section: Overview

LnBlog is a web-based weblog program that is written in PHP 4 and stores data in text files.  It 
aims to be full-featured, flexible, and configurabe, but still remain easy to use and keep 
software requirements low.  It is designed to work well on inexpensive shared web hosts.

In terms of functionality, LnBlog includes support for all the basic blogging features, such as user 
comments, TrackBacks, RSS feeds, and file uploads.  LnBlog also allows you to create multiple 
independent weblogs with multiple user accounts.  This feature is ideal for managing multiple 
sub-sites on the same web site.

One of LnBlog's main design goals in flexibility.  To this end, it includes a theme system and
a plugin system to allow user extensions.  The theme system is both powerful, allowing you to
change virtually every element on a page, yet flexible enough that you can simply override one
file for one blog without having to change or copy anything else.  Various page elements, such 
as the sidebar, are provided by plugins and can be removed or rearranged simply by moving or 
renaming plugin files.

Section: Requirements

The only hard and fast requirements for LnBlog are PHP 4.1 the ability to write files to the web
server.  LnBlog *does* support running with *safe_mode* enabled by using FTP for file writing.
You can also choose to use the standard file writing functions.  If you want to use LnBlog in a
language other than English, then the PHP gettext and iconv extensions are highly recommended, but 
not strictly required.

You can use any web server or operating system.  LnBlog is tested on Windows XP with IIS and 
Linux with Apache.  No database is required.

Section: Installation

The setup process for LnBlog is entirely web-based and mostly painless.

1) - Unzip the LnBlog archive into a directory on your hard drive.
2) - Upload the LnBlog directory to your web server.
3) - Point your web browser to the LnBlog directory on your web server.  This will start the setup 
     process.
4) - Pick the type of file writing you want.  If you have PHP *safe_mode* enabled on your web server, 
     then you *must* use FTP.  If you use "native" file writing, make sure that the LnBlog "userdata" 
     folder and the folder where you will be creating blogs are writable.  See the <fsconfig.php>
     documentation for details.  If you are using a shared hosting account or if you don't have 
     root/administrator access to the server, FTP is recommended.
5) - Set the administrator password and account information.
6) - Log in as the administrator.
7) - Start creating new users and weblogs.

Section: Upgrading

Upgrading LnBlog is normally pretty simple.  Assuming your LnBlog installation is in a folder named
"LnBlog", then you would do the following:

1) - Rename your old LnBlog directory on the server to LnBlog-old.
2) - Upload the new version into a folder named LnBlog.
3) - Copy the contents of your LnBlog-old/userdata folder into LnBlog/userdata.
4) - Copy any customized or non-standard plugins or themes from LnBlog-old to the corresponding
     location in the new LnBlog folder.
5) - Try out the new version.  If everything works, then you can delete LnBlog-old.  If not, then
     you can revert to the old version by removing the newer one and renameing LnBlog-old to LnBlog.

In some cases, there may be additional steps, but this is not the norm.  For instance, some upgrades
will require updating wrapper scripts.  This is done by going to the system administratino page (the
same one from step 3 of the <Installation> section) and running an "upgrade to current version" 
on your blog directory.
