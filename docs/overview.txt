Document: Overview and Setup

Section: Overview

LnBlog is a web-based blogging system and "mini-CMS".  It is written in PHP and requires no
database or other server software - data is stored in text and XML files.  

You can use a single LnBlog installation to create and manage multiple blogs with multiple
users.  Each blog will have its own directory on your web server and can be configured to
be editable by multiple users.  Each blog directory will store all the data for that blog,
including posts, drafts, comments, and uploaded file.

One the main design goals of LnBlog is flexibility.  To this end, it includes a theme system
and a plugin system to allow user extensions.  The theme system  allows you
to change virtually every element on a page, yet flexible enough that you can 
override one file for one blog without having to change or copy anything else.  Various
page elements, such as the sidebar, are provided by plugins and can be removed or
re-arranged from the plugin management page.

Section: Requirements

LnBlog requires PHP 7.0 or greater and the ability to write files
to the web server.  (Previous versions of LnBlog supported writing files by using an FTP
connection to the local host, but this is a legacy feature intended to work
around poorly-configured shared hosting providers that ran in safe-mode.  It is now deprecated.)

You can use any web server or operating system.  LnBlog is tested on Apache running on Windows 
and Linux, but should work on anything that will run a supported version of PHP.  You don't 
need any database or other special server setup.

If you want to use LnBlog in a language other than English, then the PHP gettext and iconv 
extensions are highly recommended, but not strictly required.  The CURL extension is also 
recommended for Pingback and TrackBacks, but this is not strictly required either.  
The gd extension is needed for thumbnail generation.


Section: Installation

The setup process for LnBlog is entirely web-based and mostly painless.  Just download the
distribution ZIP file and follow these steps.

1) - Unzip the LnBlog archive into a directory on your hard drive.  You should remove the version
     number from the directory name to make upgrades easier in the future.
2) - Upload the LnBlog directory to a web accessible location on your web server.
3) - Point your web browser to the LnBlog directory on your web server.  This will start the setup 
     process.
4) - Set or confirm the installation and userdata paths and URLs.
5) - Create a user account.  This initial user will be a system administrator.  You will be logged 
     in automatically after creation.
6) - Create a new weblog.  In addition to the normal metadata, you will be
     prompted to enter an identifier for the blog (usually the last part of
     the path) as well as the full path and URL where the blog will be
     located.  Make sure these work with your server configuration.

It is also possible to install LnBlog directly from "source", i.e. directly from a Git clone.
This process is documented in the README.md file in the source repository.

Section: Upgrading

Upgrading LnBlog is normally pretty simple.  Assuming your LnBlog installation is in a folder named
"LnBlog", then you would do the following to perform a clean upgrade.

1) - Perform a full backup of all your data by creating copies of your blog directories and
     your userdata directory.  This is not required, but is strongly recommended.  
     The upgrade process is designed be non-destructive, but it's better to be safe than sorry.
2) - Rename your old LnBlog directory on the server to LnBlog-old.
3) - Upload the new version to a folder named LnBlog.
4) - Copy the your LnBlog-old/pathconfig.php file into the new LnBlog directory.
5) - Go to the LnBlog administration page and in the "Upgrade Functions" section of the page, 
     use the "Upgrade blog to current version" tool to upgrade each of your blogs.  You can
     also do this from the command line by running "php cli.php --upgrade".

Note that the "upgrade to current version" step is not strictly required for every release - the release
notes will normally mention if this is needed.  This step will upgrade your blog data files to the current 
format.  This includes both generated scripts and the actual data files, if needed.  
Note that if a file format has changed, this will prevent you from downgrading, so it is important
to keep a backup of your blog data.

If you have installed from the Git source, you may need to run some additional commands to update
third-party dependencies.  See the README.md file in the source repository for detailed instructions.
