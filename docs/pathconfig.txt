File: pathconfig.php

There is a pathconfig.php file in the root directory of each weblog.  The purpose of this 
file is simply to the path and URL to the LnBlog installation and to define the URL to 
the blog root directory.  You can edit these values with the <blogpath.php> page. 

This file is used mainly if the initial setup does not generate the URLs you want.  For
example, if you do administration directly on the web server, then the URLs will be 
for the local host rather than the real host and domain name for your site.  Another example
would be using subdomains.  For example, if you want myblog.mydomain.com to be redirected 
to mydomain.com/myblog, then you would change the blog root to use the subdomain.  
Otherwise, all the URLs generated by LnBlog will use the subdirectory rather than the 
subdomain.
