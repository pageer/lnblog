File: pathconfig.php

There is a pathconfig.php file in the root directory of each weblog.  The purpose of this 
file is simply to the path and URL to the LnBlog installation and to define the URL to 
the blog root directory.  You can edit these values with the <blogpaths.php> page. 

Note that the only time you would really want to change this is when you move
your LnBlog installation folder, either as part of site cleanup or because you
are changing web hosts.  In either case, another easy method is to simply delete
the pathconfig.php file for your blog and run an upgrade on the blog from the
administration page, which will recreate it.
