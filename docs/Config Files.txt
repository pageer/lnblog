Title: Configuration files

File: pathconfig.php

At installation time, LnBlog will generate a pathconfig.php file and store it in the root of
the LnBlog install directory.  This file stores the paths and URLs to your LnBlog install,
userdata directory, and all of your blog directories.  LnBlog will not function if this
file is removed or corrupted.

Note that this file can be regenerated by re-running the setup process (just delete the file
and visit the admin page).  You can then re-register each of your blogs through the admin UI.

Note that there are also pathconfig.php files in the root of each blog.  These are automatically
generated by the creation and upgrade process and just tell the blog where the LnBlog
installation is located.

File: userconfig.php

This file can be used to add arbitrary PHP code to be run when a page loads.  You might use this
to change some of the configuration constants defined in <blogconfig.php> or to call ini_set()
to change the PHP configuration.  This file does not exist in the default install and must be
created in your userdata directory if you want to use it.

This is a regular PHP file.  Because it is called when a page first loads, it is important that all 
code be enclosed in PHP tags and that there be no characters or whitespace outside the PHP tags.
If there is, then you will get errors.  Likewise, any PHP syntax errors in the file will generate 
errors when the file loads.  Therefore, this is recommended only for people who know what they're 
doing.

File: userconfig.cfg

This is a simple text file that is provided as a "user friendly" alternative to the
<userconfig.php> file.  It is a text file that can be used to override configuration constants 
defined in <blogconfig.php>.  Note: *Use of this file is deprecated*.

The file uses a simple key=value format, where the configuration constant name is the key and the
setting you want is the value.  Comments begin with a hash (#) and must be on their own line.
Extra whitespace will be removed from keys and values.  Do not include quotes for sting values
unless you want them as literal characters in the value.

When a pages loads, LnBlog will read this file and define each key as a constant with the
associated value.  The values true and false will be automatically converted to boolean values, 
but all others will be treated as strings.  For a list of overridable configuration constants 
refer to <blogconfig.php>.  The constants with a listed default value can be changed.

File: fsconfig.php

Note that this is a legacy config file.  It will be created automatically and should not be modified.

Section: Format of fsconfig.php

This file is located in your userdata directory and contains a series of constant definitions, 
which determine some of the system configuration.
The exact contents will depend on the particular configuration, which is defined when you set
up LnBlog.  The available settings are described below.  Note: *This file is deprecated.*

Group: Standard Constants

Constant: FS_PLUGIN
This determines which filesystem writing method to use.
Currently, the only supported settings is "nativefs".  Previous versions supported an "ftpfs"
option in order to bypass safe-mode restrictions.  But since safe-mode has long since been removed
from PHP, that feature is now deprecated.  It still exists and can be used by setting
this value and the associated constants below, but it is not avialable from the configuration
interface and it is not tested.

Group: FTPFS-only Constants

These settings are only used by the now-deprecated FTPFS plugin.

Constant: FTPFS_USER
The username to use when establishing an FTP connection.
Note that this username *must* have write access to the relevant directories
on the server, or else this obviously will not work.

Constant: FTPFS_PASSWORD
The password used to log in with <FTPFS_USER>.
Note that this constant currently uses a plain-text password.

Constant: FTPFS_HOST
The host and/or domain name of the FTP server to connect to.
In the fairly common case where the FTP server and web server are both
running on the same machine, then you can use "localhost" for this value.
In other cases, it will probably be something like "ftp.myserver.com".

Constant: FTP_ROOT
The full path on the server to the user's FTP root.
In other words, this is the highest directory the user can access through 
FTP.  In some cases, it will be the root directory, or "/".  In other cases,
it may be something like "/home/username/".

The purpose of this constant is to convert paths on the FTP server into path
on the web server.  Because FTP servers often restrict users to a certain 
portion of the filesystem, these paths are not always the same, even when
both servers are on the same physical machine.
