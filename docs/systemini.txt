File: system.ini

The system.ini file is used to store selected default global settings.
Currently, new settings are being added this file rather than the
<blogconfig.php> file, which was previous used for all settings.  

Section: entryconfig
This section holds defaults for new blog entries.

Variable: AllowInitUpload
This is the number of file upload fields that appear on the entry edit page.
You can disable uploads from the edit page by setting this to 0.

Variable: AllowLocalPingback
This determines whether or not Pingback pings are sent to entries on the same 
server.  If set to 1, LnBlog will send Pingback pings when you link to a blog
entry on your own site.  If set to 0, it will only send ping to entries on other
servers.

Variable: GroupReplies
When set to 1, this will put all replies (comments, TrackBacks, and Pingbacks) in
a single list for display.  When set to 0, each type of reply will be displayed in a 
different section.
