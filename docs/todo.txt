Section: Known Problems

These are some of the known problems with LnBlog.  
Most of these are design and organizational problems, as opposed to "bugs" in
the sense of code errors.  Many of these will probably require more time and/or
resources than I can currently muster in order to fix.

* The theme system is kind of hard to understand.
* The use of defined constants for configuration is questionable.
* A unit testing suite would make testing much less painful.
* User permissions should be more granular.
* Have not tested effect of making the document root a blog folder.

Section: Possible Features

This is a list of features to be added to later verions.
Note that not all of these *will* be added - this is just a list of ideas.  The 
features are presented in no particular order.

* Support for PingBacks.
* AJAX interface for deleting/banning comments and trackbacks?
* Option to display trackbacks in same list as comments?
* Improved user interface for blog settings and administration.
* Support for polls?
* Multi-page articles?
* Option to publish entries as articles?
* Ability to create entry from uploaded HTML document.
* Ability to display an HTML document in the standard page layout.
* Ability to create drafts for posts and articles.
* Allow use of query strings and .htaccess rules in place of wrapper scripts.
