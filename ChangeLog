there is no explicit error set.  While the FTP file writing functions worked
without this, the native ones did not.
- Fixed fs_setup.php page so that you can actually set LnBlog to use native
file writing.  I guess I got too focused on FTP.

sheets from different themes.  Converted style sheets, templates, and pages
to use this, so it is now possible to share style sheets and images between
themes without having multiple copies of the file.
- Added code to showtrackback.php to accept a trackback ping.  It doesn't 
seem to work, though.  Maybe the server doesn't like posts to directories?

23-May-2005:
- Extensive changes to user authentication.  Added support for multiple user
accounts with information (e-mail, real name, etc.) for the user.
- Added a permissions mechanism to the Blog class.  New articles and entries
are now added and modified by methods of the Blog class.  Permission is 
determined based on an administrator account, the Blog owner, a "writers" 
list for the blog, and the owner of an existing entry or article.
- Tweaks to display templates to make partial user/reader information show
up in a nicer format.

property, but still set the template variables appropriately.

all the time, not just when there are comments.

16-Apr-2005: Version 0.2.1
- Fixed bone-head bug in stipping HTML entities.

comment RSS for entry, article, and comment pages.

- Added preview function for posting or editing entries and articles.
- Added RSS feeds for comments on articles and entries.

08-Apr-2005:
- Fixed error where the original post date was not tracked in the entry 
metadata.  Post date and current version date are now separate in both the
metadata and the template variables.
- Fixed (hopefully) a bug in the LBCode regexps for lists that required a new
line at the end and beginning of a list.
- Added destination name to successful file upload message.
- Fixed missing license section in Readme.html file.  Oops!

post an entry and upload the files for the 0.2.0 release. ;)
- Fixed missing template variable errors in new blog page.
- Fixed error where comment delete was not picking up the comments directory
when showing entry and comments and ended up linking to entry delete.
- Fixed error updating articles caused by inherited update() method calling
getPath(), which was changed in BlogEntry, but not article.
- OK, let's make THIS release 0.2.0.

04-Apr-2005
- Fixed several templates so that the HTML actually validates now.
- Added some styles to make forms slightly nicer.
- Added ordered and unordered lists to LBCode.
- Added a "sticky" file for articles that gives a quick and easy way
to determine if they are to be displayed in the sidebar.
- Added delete() function to FS plugin interface to work with the
sticky files for articles.
- We'll call this release 0.2.0.  It's finally worth using!  Yay!

01-Apr-2005:
- Fixed pages for adding and editing articles and entries to preserve the
form data if there is an error.
- Added a field to new article page that allows setting the branch name, i.e.
the directory component of the path under the content directory.
- On second thought, maybe home directories should be easy to configure.  
Moved the regular expression in localpath_to_uri() to a constant in the
blogconfig.php file.
- Fixed bugs in showmonth.php, include_sidebar.php.
- Added config option for number of entries to put in RSS feeds.

31-Mar-2005:
- Fixed localpath_to_uri() for home directories yet again.  This time, it 
uses a regular expression to match /home/.+/www, like I use on my system.
This is a dirty, dirty hack, but I can't see it coming up too often.
- Various LBCode (LnBlog BBCode) tags have been added and documented.
- Changed FTP file writing to use binary in stead of ASCII mode.  This fixes
a CrLf conversion problem I was having.
- Added code to autoconvert relative paths in LBCode [url] and [img] tags to
absolute URIs.  This should help make the RSS feeds validate.

21-Mar-2005:
- Fixed blog creation bug (realpath() doesn't work on non-existent 
ARTICLE_POST_URL files).
- Fixed localpath_to_uri() to work with user home directories, i.e. ~/www.

18-Mar-2005:
- Integrated FTP file writing into code.  Can select between writing files
and directories using native filesystem functions or FTP functions using 
"pluggable" filesystem classes.

13-Mar-2005:
- File upload support added.

03-Mar-2005:
- Changed name from Basic Blog, which was too common and kind of sucked, to
LnBlog, seems to be fairly uncommon and sucks slightly less.

02-Mar-2005: Version 0.1.0
- Initial public release.
