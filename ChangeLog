- Fixed bugs and removed debugging code that showed up when attempting to
post an entry and upload the files for the 0.2.0 release. ;)
- Fixed missing template variable errors in new blog page.
- Fixed error where comment delete was not picking up the comments directory
when showing entry and comments and ended up linking to entry delete.
- Fixed error updating articles caused by inherited update() method calling
getPath(), which was changed in BlogEntry, but not article.
- OK, let's make THIS release 0.2.0.

04-Apr-2005:
- Fixed several templates so that the HTML actually validates now.
- Added some styles to make forms slightly nicer.
- Added ordered and unordered lists to LBCode.
- Added a "sticky" file for articles that gives a quick and easy way
to determine if they are to be displayed in the sidebar.
- Added delete() function to FS plugin interface to work with the
sticky files for articles.
- We'll call this release 0.2.0.  It's finally worth using!  Yay!

01-Apr-2005:
- Fixed pages for adding and editing articles and entries to preserve the
form data if there is an error.
- Added a field to new article page that allows setting the branch name, i.e.
the directory component of the path under the content directory.
- On second thought, maybe home directories should be easy to configure.  
Moved the regular expression in localpath_to_uri() to a constant in the
blogconfig.php file.
- Fixed bugs in showmonth.php, include_sidebar.php.
- Added config option for number of entries to put in RSS feeds.

31-Mar-2005:
- Fixed localpath_to_uri() for home directories yet again.  This time, it 
uses a regular expression to match /home/.+/www, like I use on my system.
This is a dirty, dirty hack, but I can't see it coming up too often.
- Various LBCode (LnBlog BBCode) tags have been added and documented.
- Changed FTP file writing to use binary in stead of ASCII mode.  This fixes
a CrLf conversion problem I was having.
- Added code to autoconvert relative paths in LBCode [url] and [img] tags to
absolute URIs.  This should help make the RSS feeds validate.

21-Mar-2005:
- Fixed blog creation bug (realpath() doesn't work on non-existentARTICLE_POST_URL files.
- Fixed localpath_to_uri() to work with user home directories, i.e. ~/www.

18-Mar-2005:
- Integrated FTP file writing into code.  Can select between writing files
and directories using native filesystem functions or FTP functions using 
"pluggable" filesystem classes.

13-Mar-2005:
- File upload support added.

03-Mar-2005:
- Changed name from Basic Blog, which was too common and kind of sucked, to
LnBlog, seems to be fairly uncommon and sucks slightly less.

Version 0.1.0: 02-Mar-2005
- Initial public release.
