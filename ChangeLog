19-May-2006:
- Added option to sitemap plugin to auto-generate the sitemap from the
registered blog list.
- Fixed up the authentication code in various files.
- Removed the BLOG_ROOT_URL constant, which was almost certainly a stupid idea
in the first place.  Maybe something like it can come back in a different
incarnation, if it's even needed.

- Fixes to login, logout, and blog registration.
- Removed more deprecated methods from blog object.

setTemplate methods are not implemented, as they are not relevant to LnBlog.

- Changed default character encoding to UTF-8.

10-May-2006:

of the standard default theme.

- Added working contentban plugin based on ipban.
- Added NaturalDocs documentaiton to some plugins, as well as converting
older ones to use the addOption method.

31-Mar-2006:
- When saving blog data, run the values through htmlentities() first in order
to prevent invalid characters from getting into the title or description.  
This breaks the RSS feeds and XHTML compliance (reported by Ben Schorr).

30-Mar-2006:
- Reworked include mechanism AGAIN so that blogconfig and pathconfig will work.
- Added a privateblog plugin.  This allows you to deny access to a blog to 
all but a certain list of usernames.

27-Mar-2006: 
- Reworked blogconfig.php to work with pathconfig.php.
- Added documentation on pathconfig.php.
- Moved LBCode documentation to NaturalDocs.

27-Mar-2006:

scripts in each directory.  Now, the config.php files calculate the blog root
based on how many levels deep the directory is under the blog.  The install
root and install and blog URLs are then included from a new pathconfig.php
file in the blog root.
- Cleaned up newblog.php, updateblog.php, and blog_modify_tpl.php to remove all
those unneeded variables.

with no /, :, or @ characters into absolute URIs relative to the current 
path, while ones with / but no : or @ are relative to the blog root.

20-Mar-2006:
- Fixes broken "back to plugin list" link.
- Removed broken default banner when plugin is disabled.

a new blog.

17-Mar-2006: version 0.6.3
- Made the plugin loading configuration page not suck.

for all variations on /home/user/whatever as the LnBlog doucment root.

- Fixed wrong file name in sitemap.php.
- Sort IP addresses when saving sitemap.

10-Mar-2006: version 0.6.2
- Fixed entry deletion when history is disabled.  The rmdir() and rmdir_rec()
functions for the FS classes were trying to delete a directory that was still
in use.  Also, we apparently can't delete the directory the script is being
run from, so the entry delete.php wrappers can't be used.  Instead, adjusted
deletion links to use the pages/delentry.php directly.  This required 
adjustments to current_file() and current_uri() to maintain query strings
and addition of a couple of methods to blogentry class.

08-Mar-2006: 
- Fixed conditional inversion error in rmdir_rec() in nativefs.  This caused 
calls to the function to completely fail.

default) and the math symbols.

compatibility for old passwd.php file.
- Fixed JS bug in login_create_tpl.php

18-Jan-2006:

articles or entries.  Otherwise, we can end up injecting invalid HTML into
the edit fields and messing up the page.

without this, the native ones did not.

file writing.  I guess I got too focused on FTP.

23-May-2005:
- Extensive changes to user authentication.  Added support for multiple user
accounts with information (e-mail, real name, etc.) for the user.
- Added a permissions mechanism to the Blog class.  New articles and entries
are now added and modified by methods of the Blog class.  Permission is 
determined based on an administrator account, the Blog owner, a "writers" 
list for the blog, and the owner of an existing entry or article.
- Tweaks to display templates to make partial user/reader information show
up in a nicer format.

all the time, not just when there are comments.

16-Apr-2005: Version 0.2.1

- Added preview function for posting or editing entries and articles.
- Added RSS feeds for comments on articles and entries.

08-Apr-2005:

metadata.  Post date and current version date are now separate in both the
metadata and the template variables.
- Fixed (hopefully) a bug in the LBCode regexps for lists that required a new
line at the end and beginning of a list.
- Added destination name to successful file upload message.
- Fixed missing license section in Readme.html file.  Oops!

- Fixed error where comment delete was not picking up the comments directory
when showing entry and comments and ended up linking to entry delete.
- Fixed error updating articles caused by inherited update() method calling
getPath(), which was changed in BlogEntry, but not article.
- OK, let's make THIS release 0.2.0.

04-Apr-2005
- Fixed several templates so that the HTML actually validates now.
- Added some styles to make forms slightly nicer.
- Added ordered and unordered lists to LBCode.
- Added a "sticky" file for articles that gives a quick and easy way
to determine if they are to be displayed in the sidebar.
- Added delete() function to FS plugin interface to work with the
sticky files for articles.
- We'll call this release 0.2.0.  It's finally worth using!  Yay!

01-Apr-2005:
- Fixed pages for adding and editing articles and entries to preserve the
form data if there is an error.
- Added a field to new article page that allows setting the branch name, i.e.
the directory component of the path under the content directory.

Moved the regular expression in localpath_to_uri() to a constant in the
blogconfig.php file.
- Fixed bugs in showmonth.php, include_sidebar.php.
- Added config option for number of entries to put in RSS feeds.

31-Mar-2005:
- Fixed localpath_to_uri() for home directories yet again.  This time, it 
uses a regular expression to match /home/.+/www, like I use on my system.
This is a dirty, dirty hack, but I can't see it coming up too often.
- Various LBCode (LnBlog BBCode) tags have been added and documented.
- Changed FTP file writing to use binary in stead of ASCII mode.  This fixes
a CrLf conversion problem I was having.
- Added code to autoconvert relative paths in LBCode [url] and [img] tags to
absolute URIs.  This should help make the RSS feeds validate.

21-Mar-2005:
- Fixed blog creation bug (realpath() doesn't work on non-existent 
ARTICLE_POST_URL files).
- Fixed localpath_to_uri() to work with user home directories, i.e. ~/www.

18-Mar-2005:
- Integrated FTP file writing into code.  Can select between writing files
and directories using native filesystem functions or FTP functions using 
"pluggable" filesystem classes.

13-Mar-2005:
- File upload support added.

03-Mar-2005:
- Changed name from Basic Blog, which was too common and kind of sucked, to
LnBlog, seems to be fairly uncommon and sucks slightly less.

02-Mar-2005: Version 0.1.0
- Initial public release.
