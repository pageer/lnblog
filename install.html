<title>LnBlog Installation</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Installing LnBlog</h1>
<p>The installation for LnBlog is a fairly easy process.  For those who
are not technologically inclined, just follow these step-by-step instructions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Download and uncompress the LnBlog archive.</strong><p>
The downloaded archive is a standard ZIP file format.  On Windows you can 
decompress this with WinZip or pretty much any other compression program.  On
Linux, you can use your desktop environment's decompression utility, such as 
Ark, or run <code>unzip&nbsp;lnblog-version.zip</code> from the command 
line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Upload the LnBlog folder to your web host.</strong><p>
Use your favorite FTP program to upload the entire LnBlog installation
folder to your web hosting account.  The folder <em>must</em> go someplace 
under your web root.  If you place it outside the web root, you will not be 
able to run the setup and configuration programs.  Usually it is easiest to 
simply put the LnBlog folder in the root of your website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Change folder permissions on the web server.</strong><p>
After uploading the LnBlog folder, you need to change the security on it.
On Linux/Apache serves, this generally means making the directory writable 
to everyone.  If you don't do this, you will not be able to create a login in
the next step.  If you don't like having this folder world-writable, you can
always change the permissions back once you finish setting up a login.</p>
<p>The exact method for changing permissions will vary with your FTP tool.
I use Konqueror's integrated FTP support, so I can change permissions in the
file properties box.  I also use the LFTP command-line FTP client, which
supports a chmod command.  Some clients, such as the Windows command-line
ftp.exe program, do not support changing permissions.</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong>, you might also want to change the
permissions on your web root directory to be world-writable as well.  If you 
do not, then each time you create a new blog, you will have to manually 
create the directory and make it writable.</p></li>
<li>
<strong>Create an administrative login.</strong><p>
Once the LnBlog folder permissions are set, you can open up your web 
browser and navigate to it.  If you put the foler in your website root and 
named it just "lnblog", then you would navigate to 
http://www.yoursite.com/lnblog/ to
find it.  When you do this, you will be prompted to create an administrative 
login.  This login will be used to add new blogs, upgrade old blogs, and will
also be the default login for any blogs you create.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Log in.</strong><p>
After creating an administrative account, you will be directed to the login 
page.  Enter the username and password you just created and you will see the
administrative page.  </p></li>
<li>
<strong>Create a new blog.</strong><p>
Click on the "Add new blog" link to create a new weblog.
On the new weblog page, you can enter the path to the blog, the name, a 
description, the web server path to an icon for the blog, the theme to use
(LnBlog ships with two themes: "default", which I think is very nice,
and "skepticats", which is the original and somewhat less nice theme)
and the maximum 
number of entries to display on the front page.  When you are done, hit 
submit and you will be taken to the front page of your new blog.</p><p>
<strong>Please note</strong> that it is best to use a relative path to the 
blog.  So, if the URL of LnBlog on your site is 
http://mysite.com/lnblog/ and you want to create a blog at 
http://mysite.com/myblog/, then you When you should give the path as 
../myblog.</p><p>
<strong>Also note</strong> that if the web server account does not have 
write permissions to the directory where you want the blog, then LnBlog
will not be able to create it.  You can either change the permissions on the
folder that will contain your weblog folder, or you can manually create the
folder and change the permissions to be writable by everyone.</p>
