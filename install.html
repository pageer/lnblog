<title>LnBlog Installation</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Installing LnBlog</h1>
<p>The installation for LnBlog is a fairly easy process.  For those who
are not technologically inclined, just follow these step-by-step instructions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Download and uncompress the LnBlog archive.</strong><p>
The downloaded archive is a standard ZIP file format.  On Windows you can 
decompress this with WinZip or pretty much any other compression program.  On
Linux, you can use your desktop environment's decompression utility, such as 
Ark, or run <code>unzip&nbsp;lnblog-version.zip</code> from the command 
line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Upload the LnBlog folder to your web host.</strong><p>
Use your favorite FTP program to upload the entire LnBlog installation
folder to your web hosting account.  The folder <em>must</em> go someplace 
under your web root.  If you place it outside the web root, you will not be 
able to run the setup and configuration programs.  Usually it is easiest to 
simply put the LnBlog folder in the root of your website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Set up file the writing plugin.</strong><p>
After uploading the LnBlog folder, you can open up your web browser and 
navigate to it.  If, for example, you put the foler in your website root and 
named it just "lnblog", then you would navigate to 
<code>http://www.yoursite.com/lnblog/</code> to find it.  The first time you
visit this page, LnBlog will present you with the FTP file writing 
configuration page.</p>
<p>LnBlog provides two ways to write files on the web server.  The first way
is to use the "native" filesystem functions.  To configure this, all you need
do is leave the "use FTP" box unchecked and hit the submit button.  This is 
not recommended, however, because you will need to manually change file 
permissions to make the directories you want to put blogs in writable by 
everyone.  Furthermore, your account <em>will not</em> own any files or 
directories that LnBlog creates, which can cause problems if you want to 
manage your site outside the software.</p>
<p>The second, and recommended, method for writing files is to use the FTP
interface.  This requires that you be able to access you web space via FTP,
which you almost certainly can.  To configure this, you need to check the
"use FTP" box, enter your username and password, and confirm the FTP host 
name and the path to your FTP root.  The FTP host name (which you will 
probably have to change) is the server address that you use to upload files 
to your site, such as <code>ftp.mysite.com</code>.  In the (fairly common) 
case where the FTP and web servers are the same system, you can also use 
'localhost'.  The FTP root path is an absolute path to the root of your site,
i.e. where you end up when you FTP into your site.  By default LnBlog guesses
that this is two levels above where it is installed, which is probably right 
if you put LnBlog in your web root.  The optional prefix value is a string to
prepend to all FTP paths, such as the '~' character.  The prefix is intended 
primarily for developer testing and is usually not required.</p></li>
<li>
<strong>Create an administrative login.</strong><p>
Once you enter your file writing information, LnBlog will prompt you to
create an administrative login.  This login will be used to add new blogs,
upgrade old blogs, and will also be the default login for any blogs you 
create.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Log in.</strong><p>
After creating an administrative account, you will be directed to the login 
page.  Enter the username and password you just created and you will see the
administrative page.  </p></li>
<li>
<strong>Create a new blog.</strong><p>
Click on the "Add new blog" link to create a new weblog.
On the new weblog page, you can enter the path to the blog, the name, a 
description, the web server path to an icon for the blog, the theme to use
(LnBlog ships with two themes: "default", which I think is very nice,
and "skepticats", which is the original and somewhat less nice theme)
and the maximum 
number of entries to display on the front page.  When you are done, hit 
submit and you will be taken to the front page of your new blog.</p><p>
<strong>Please note</strong> that it is best to use a relative path to the 
blog.  So, if the URL of LnBlog on your site is 
http://mysite.com/lnblog/ and you want to create a blog at 
http://mysite.com/myblog/, then you When you should give the path as 
../myblog.</p><p>
<strong>Also note</strong> that if the web server account does not have 
write permissions to the directory where you want the blog, then LnBlog
will not be able to create it.  You can either change the permissions on the
folder that will contain your weblog folder, or you can manually create the
folder and change the permissions to be writable by everyone.</p>
